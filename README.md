2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd databolt
    ```
3. Ensure the data files are in the correct directory structure as expected by the scripts.

### Executing program

1. Ensure the data files are in the following paths:
    - `Data/Olympics/olympic_hosts.csv`
    - `Data/Olympics/olympic_medals.csv`

2. Run the visualization script:
    ```sh
    python DataSetVisualier9000.py
    ```

3. Run the prediction script:
    ```sh
    python OlymPicsGenerator500.py
    ```
The first script (DataSetVisualiser9000) will generate a singular graph, which can be saved if wanted.
The second script (OlymPicsGenerator500) will generate plots based on the provided data and save them to an output folder directory.
